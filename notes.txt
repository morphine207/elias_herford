I want to build a learning application for Kreis Paderborn for their employees - it will be a mandatory digital 
education for their employees which is mostly the a boring learning course which consists of sildes sometimes with
audio. In the end they have multiple choice questions quiz where they need to get a certain score to complete the
course. We want to create an improved application with an initial user prompt where we take the user 
learning preference, if they would like more of a visual/audio/text based learning experience.

The prompt question should be detailed but not too verbose, so that we can gauge the exact user learning preference,
 job description, and content style - so we can use this to modify the content to a realistic extent to make it more 
 custom to the user.

There should also be a technical news/latest update box that is relevant to that particular slide content on the 
bottom of the page and on the top right or the far right side a virtual AI assistant (a 3d gen ai based model 
using 3js or any other framework, easy to implement)

A feedback button on every silde that the user can click and that pops up(optional), and a detailed feedback at the
end of the course

Create a detailed workflow and a user story and also suggest the basic architecture for building a prototype
(The tech stack I wish is React & FastAPI)

ChatGPt - 

Here’s a minimal, easy-to-build architecture and workflow using React + FastAPI, entirely file-based and JSON-driven — ideal for a first working prototype.

⚙️ Simplified System Architecture
 ┌──────────────────────────────┐
 │ Frontend: React              │
 │ - Renders slides & UI        │
 │ - Handles user preference    │
 │ - Shows quiz & feedback      │
 │ - Fetches data from FastAPI  │
 └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                │  (HTTP/JSON)
 ┌──────────────┴───────────────┐
 │ Backend: FastAPI             │
 │ - Serves static JSON data    │
 │ - Adapts content per pref    │
 │ - Stores feedback locally    │
 │ - Fetches relevant news via  │
 │   News API or static feed    │
 └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                │
      Local JSON files in /data/


No database, no auth, no external dependencies beyond HTTP requests.

🧠 Core Flow (Step-by-Step)
1. Start Page → Learning Preference Prompt

When the app opens, show a simple form:

Example fields:

Learning preference → visual / audio / text

Role → short free text

Detail level → short / medium / in-depth

Enable news updates → yes/no

After submission, store preferences in React state (or localStorage).

2. Fetch Course Content

React fetches course content from a static JSON served by FastAPI, e.g.
GET /api/course/<course_id> → loads slides with fields like:

{
  "title": "Data Protection Basics",
  "slides": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "text",
      "topic": "GDPR Overview",
      "content": "The General Data Protection Regulation ...",
      "keywords": ["data protection", "privacy", "gdpr"],
      "image": "/static/gdpr_infographic.png",
      "audio": "/static/gdpr_intro.mp3"
    }
  ]
}


React displays the slide type based on user preference:

If visual: show the infographic prominently.

If audio: auto-play narration.

If text: focus on written summary.

3. Technical News Box

Each slide’s keywords are used by FastAPI to fetch updates from a News API (or a cached JSON file).
FastAPI endpoint example:

@app.get("/api/news")
def get_news(topic: str):
    # For prototype: return static curated news snippets
    with open("data/news.json") as f:
        all_news = json.load(f)
    return [n for n in all_news if topic.lower() in n["keywords"]]


The frontend displays these in a small scrollable box below each slide.

4. 3D AI Assistant (Right Sidebar)

A simple Three.js canvas with a pre-made 3D avatar (no chat needed yet).
Later, you can add:

Voice greeting (“Hi, I’ll guide you through this course!”)

Tooltip pop-ups

Optional chatbot via API

5. Feedback Button (Per Slide)

Each slide has a small feedback button → popup with quick options:

👍 Helpful

👎 Confusing

💬 Comment (optional text area)

React sends this to FastAPI:
POST /api/feedback

{
  "slide_id": 1,
  "rating": "confusing",
  "comment": "Too much text"
}


FastAPI appends it to a local file:

@app.post("/api/feedback")
def save_feedback(data: dict):
    with open("data/feedback.json", "a") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(data) + "\n")
    return {"status": "ok"}

6. Quiz & Completion

At the end of the course, show a multiple-choice quiz:

{
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What does GDPR stand for?",
      "options": ["General Data Privacy Rules", "General Data Protection Regulation"],
      "answer": 1
    }
  ]
}


Frontend grades it locally → displays score → shows completion message.
You can later post results to FastAPI for analytics, but initially you can just store them in localStorage.
